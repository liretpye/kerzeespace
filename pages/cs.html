	<h1>UWorld is the leading medical examination test preparation in the world.</h1>
	<p class="cs-body">UWorld started as USMLEWorld and they had one goal, make it easier to ace the USMLE. They succeeded at that goal with no marketing, minimal design, and just good old fashioned hard work. Their tests are now used by over 80% of medical students in the United States. Ground Glass and our friends at Velcrokid had the great privilege to be their first real design and marketing team. We started by changing their name to UWorld. I served as the lead graphic designer throughout the project. </p>
